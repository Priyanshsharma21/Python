try catch
In order to detect error so that our programe will not stop on error line and continue
other execution we use try catch error

key(not exist), index(not exist), type error(int to str)

try -> code that can give us error
excect-> If error comes this runs
else -> our try success then else run
finnaly -> dont care it will always runs

try:
file = open("hello.txt")
dict = {name:"priyash"}
print(dict["age"])

except FileNotFoundError:
file = open("hello.txt", "w")
except KeyError as errorMessage:
print(f"There is a {errorMessange}")

else:
content = file.read
print(content)

finally :
file.close()
