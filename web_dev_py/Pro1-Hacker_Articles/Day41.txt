How internet work

1.
Internet is like a long wire through which all the devices (computer) connected
Some computers are there 27/7 which are called servers
And computer who request is client

2.
We type google.com
client(us)----request send to -----> Internet provider (ISP)
ISP-----send it to ---> DNS server-----> DNS return website IP address
Now we got ip address
we send that ip to ISP and ISP through internet backbone send it to SERVER
from there we get our data

How website work

We need a browser who look up to ipaddress from DNS
we send request of data and this data is in form of HTML,CSS,JS
HTML-> Structure of our website
CSS -> Stying of website
JS -> Functionality of website


HTML ->
We have elemant, attributes-> combine called tag
we have selfClosing and clocing tags
