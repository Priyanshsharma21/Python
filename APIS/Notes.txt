When we send req as structured accordingly to external server it will respond to our request

"API is like menu through which we can interact with external system data"

Endpoint -> Is the url which will give us the data
http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json ---> Like this

Enviroment VAriables ->
1. For convenience ->
When we deploy large app we dont wanna make changes in main.py insteed there is some sort of way like evn variable
in which we make changes
2. Security ->
Also you dont wanna show some sort of data like api key to public so we store this things in env variable

export API_KEY=3jn3en3n3nrnn3n4ne3me
