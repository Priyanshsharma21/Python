In turtle we have write function which take milltiple args in input
But if we dont fill those args it take it as default

*args -> Positional args
in function if we write like this, it will take only 2 args

def add(num1,num2):
return num1+num2

add(2,4)

But what we wnat multiple args so we can use (*args)
it will allow us to give as much args as we want

def add(*args):
for i in args:
print(i)

add(a=10,b=20,c=40,z=20....)

it put all the args in tuple and loop all through and perform inst


**kwargs -> Keyword args

def calculator(**kwargs):




calculator(add=3, mult=5)

It store key value -> dict values

tkinter layout->
1.Pack(side="left") start from top and pack items in loc=gical manner
2.Place(x,y) -> we can gove coordinated
